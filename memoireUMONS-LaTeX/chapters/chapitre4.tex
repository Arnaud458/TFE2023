\section{Méthode des constellations Traces}

\subsection{paramètrage}

3 modules lora

module rn2483

module pycom fipy

module arduino

paramètres d'émission : 
SF =7, BW = 125, Freq = 868Mhz, CR = 4/5, mod = Lora


plot des DCTF (differential constellation traces figure)

\subsection{training phase}

during the training phase, you use differential constellation trace figures (DCTFs) from different modules. The objective is to identify clusters in these figures and learn the characteristics of each module.

\subsection{testing phase}

In your case, during the testing phase, you have new DCTFs from modules that the model has not seen during training. The model uses what it learned to predict the category or cluster for each DCTF.
